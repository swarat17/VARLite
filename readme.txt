Seed-based Team Classification and Offside Detection

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (Code.ipynb) and run the last cell (specify the sample image in the main function)

2. A window will prompt you to click once on a left-team player, then once on a right-team player.

3. The script will automatically classify all players by HSV histogram, detect field lines, compute vanishing point, and overlay the offside line.

4. The final annotated image will be displayed.
